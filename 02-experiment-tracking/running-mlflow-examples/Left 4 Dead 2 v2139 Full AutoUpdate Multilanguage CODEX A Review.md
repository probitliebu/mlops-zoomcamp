## Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi Movie Review
 
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is not just a romantic comedy, but also a tribute to the Bollywood cinema and its stars. The film features several references and homages to the classic films and actors of Hindi cinema, especially the three Khans: Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh. The film also has a special song, "Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte", which features cameo appearances by five leading actresses: Kajol, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, Bipasha Basu and Lara Dutta.
 
The film is also a showcase of Shah Rukh Khan's versatility and charisma as an actor. He plays two contrasting roles: Surinder Sahni, the simple and shy office worker who loves his wife unconditionally, and Raj Kapoor, the flamboyant and fun-loving alter ego who tries to woo his wife with his charm and dance moves. Shah Rukh Khan delivers a brilliant performance in both roles, switching between them effortlessly and convincingly. He makes the audience laugh, cry and cheer for him throughout the film.
 
Anushka Sharma makes an impressive debut as Taani, the young and spirited woman who finds herself in a loveless marriage with Surinder. She portrays her character's emotions and dilemmas with grace and maturity. She also matches Shah Rukh Khan's energy and chemistry in the dance sequences. The film also has a strong supporting cast, especially Vinay Pathak as Surinder's friend Bobby, who helps him transform into Raj.
 
The film is directed by Aditya Chopra, who returns to direction after eight years. He creates a heartwarming and entertaining story that celebrates love in its various forms. He also infuses the film with humour, music and drama that keep the audience engaged. The film has a catchy soundtrack composed by Salim-Sulaiman, with lyrics by Jaideep Sahni. The songs are well-picturised and choreographed by Shiamak Davar and Vaibhavi Merchant.
 
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is a film that will make you smile, laugh and cry with its simple yet touching story of an ordinary couple who find extraordinary love. It is a film that will make you believe that there is a match made by God for everyone.
