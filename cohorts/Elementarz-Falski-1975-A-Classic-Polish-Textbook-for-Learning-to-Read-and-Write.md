The history of Elementarz Falski is closely linked to the history of Poland and its education system. Marian Falski, the author of the textbook, was a Polish pedagogue and linguist who lived in turbulent times. He was born in 1881 in Nacz, near NowogrÃ³dek, which was then part of the Russian Empire. He studied engineering at Warsaw University, but he had to flee to KrakÃ³w in 1907 after being involved in anti-Russian activities. There he worked as a private tutor and a researcher at Jagiellonian University, where he obtained his doctorate on the psychology of reading under the supervision of Professor WÅadysÅaw Heinrich.
 
Falski was passionate about improving the literacy and education of Polish people, especially in rural areas. He was inspired by the works of Jan Amos KomenskÃ½, a Czech educator and philosopher who advocated for universal and progressive education. Falski developed his own method of teaching reading and writing, based on phonetics and visual aids. He wrote his first textbook, Elementarz dla I klasy szkÃ³Å wiejskich (Basal Reader for First Grade of Rural Schools), in 1910. The textbook was an instant success and was widely adopted by Polish schools.
 
After Poland regained its independence in 1918, Falski became a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Religion and Public Education. He was responsible for reforming and modernizing the Polish education system, as well as promoting cultural and scientific cooperation with other countries. He was also an expert of the League of Nations on the reorganization of China's educational system in 1931. He continued to revise and update his textbook, which became known simply as Elementarz (Basal Reader). The textbook was translated into several languages, including Belarusian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Hebrew, and Chinese.
 
During World War II, Falski stayed in Warsaw and participated in the underground education movement. He also took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. After the war, he moved to ÅÃ³dÅº, where he worked as a professor at the University of ÅÃ³dÅº until his retirement in 1951. He died in 1974 at the age of 92.
 
Elementarz Falski has been reprinted many times since its first edition. The most popular version is the one illustrated by Janusz GrabiaÅski, a renowned Polish artist and cartoonist. GrabiaÅski created his illustrations for Elementarz Falski in 1958 and they have become iconic images of Polish culture. His drawings are colorful, expressive, and humorous, capturing the spirit and charm of the texts. They also reflect the social and historical changes that Poland underwent in the 20th century.
 
Elementarz Falski is more than just a textbook. It is a cultural phenomenon that has shaped the minds and hearts of millions of Polish people. It is a source of nostalgia, pride, and identity for many generations. It is also a testament to the vision and dedication of Marian Falski, who devoted his life to educating his nation.
